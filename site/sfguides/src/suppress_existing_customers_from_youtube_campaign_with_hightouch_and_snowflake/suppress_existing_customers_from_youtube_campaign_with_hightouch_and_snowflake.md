# Suppress existing customers from a Youtube campaign with Hightouch and Snowflake
<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Overview 
Duration: 1

Hightouch helps marketers activate their data, sitting in Snowflake, to over 100 different destinations.  It provides the "last mile" of the [Modern Data Stack](https://hightouch.com/blog/reverse-etl-bringing-the-modern-data-stack-full-circle).

Sometimes a brand wants to suppress some or all existing customers from an ad campaign. This could be because the campaign is a propsecting campaign, and does not have messaging that makes sense for existing customers. It could also be because the brand offers something like a subscription, which can only be purchased once.  Or, it could be a product with a slow replenishment cycle, where recent purchasers are very unlikely to purchase again so soon.  This is the scenario we will explore with this Quickstart, where recent purchasers are added as an excluded audience segment in a Youtube campaign through Google Ads.

### Prerequisites
- Basic experience with Snowflake and SQL
- Access to Hightouch with the "audiences" feature enabled. Reach out for a [demo](https://hightouch.com/demo) if needed.

### What You’ll Learn 
- how to create test data in Snowflake
- how to connect Hightouch to Snowflake
- how to create an audience in Google Ads for Youtube from this data

### What You’ll Build 
- An audience for suppression within Google Ads

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Prepare your audience within Snowflake
Duration: 4

First, you need to have the data that you want to push prepared within Snowflake.

### Log in to Snowflake

If you already have a Snowflake account, you can use your credentials to log in.  If you do not already have an account, you can visit [https://signup.snowflake.com/]https://signup.snowflake.com/ to sign up for a 30-day free trial.  You will want to make sure that the account you use in Snowflake has the permissions to create a new database, schema, and warehouse to be used by Hightouch.

### Set-up Hightouch through Parner Connect

You can set up a database, schema, and warehouse for use with Hightouch by setting up Hightouch through Partner Connect in Snowsight.  See the [https://hightouch.com/blog/hightouch-snowflake-partner-connect](detailed instructions) on the Hightouch Blog for more details.

1. Click the **Partner Connect** tab under **Admin**.

2. Search for Hightouch (or scroll to the **Data Integration** section), and select it.
![Select Hightouch](assets/hightouch-setup-step2.png)
3. View the Database, Warehouse, User, and Role that will be created for the integration, and click **Launch**.
![Click Launch](assets/hightouch-setup-step3.png)
4. When the creation is complete, you will see a pop-up telling you that the creation has finished.  Click **Activate** to be taken to Hightouch to log in.
![Click Activate](assets/hightouch-setup-step4.png)
5. Log in to Hightouch using your Hightouch credentials, and you will have a Data Source from Snowflake created in Hightouch.

### Create test data

First, we need to create a database and schema to hold the data.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE HIGHTOUCH_QUICKSTART;
CREATE SCHEMA HIGHTOUCH_QUICKSTART.DEMO;

USE HIGHTOUCH_QUICKSTART.DEMO;
```

Next, we create the customers and sales data, and a view to unify them to make the audience.

```sql
-- create customer list
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE customers AS
SELECT sha1(seq4()) as user_id,
  'user'||seq4()||'_'||uniform(1, 3, random(2))||'@email.com' as email
  FROM table(generator(rowcount => 100000));

-- verify the data
select * from customers;

-- create random sales for those customers
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE sales AS
select sha1(uniform(1, 100000, random(3)))::varchar(40) as user_id
  ,dateadd(second, uniform(1, 5256576, random(4)), ('2022-09-01'::timestamp)) as sale_timestamp
  ,uniform(10000,20000,random(5)) as cost_cents
from table(generator(rowcount=>50000));

-- verify the data
select * from sales;

-- first create a schema to hold the customer sales
CREATE SCHEMA PC_HIGHTOUCH_DB.CUSTOMER_SALES;
USE PC_HIGHTOUCH_DB.CUSTOMER_SALES;

-- create a view for easy lookup
create or replace view customer_sales
select c.email, max(s.sale_timestamp) as latest_sale, sum(cost_cents)/100 as ltv_dollars
from customers c
 inner join sales s on s.user_id=c.user_id
group by 1;

-- verify the data
select * from customer_sales;
```

Now we need to grant access to the view to Hightouch.

```sql
GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE HIGHTOUCH_QUICKSTART TO ROLE PC_HIGHTOUCH_ROLE;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA HIGHTOUCH_QUICKSTART.DEMO TO ROLE PC_HIGHTOUCH_ROLE;
GRANT SELECT ON VIEW HIGHTOUCH_QUICKSTART.DEMO.customer_sales TO ROLE PC_HIGHTOUCH_ROLE;
```

## Create audience and configure destination in Hightouch
Duration: 8

Now that we have our test data, we need to create the audience in Hightouch and push it to Google Ads.  Connecting to Hightouch from Snowflake above created the data source within Hightouch, which will be used below.

### Creating a Google Ads destination

In order to push data to Google Ads for use with a Youtube campaign, we need to create a destination.

1. Navigate to destinations and click **Add Destination**. Select Google Ads and click **Continue**. (Screenshot)
2. Connect to Google Ads. This will open up a new window to input your credentials. Once done, click **Continue**. (Screenshot)
3. Name the destination and click **Finish**. (Screenshot)

### Create your audience

Next you need to create the audience within Hightouch.

1. Go to the **Audiences** tab and click on **Add audience**.
![Add audience](assets/create_audience_step_1.png)
2. Select the "customer_sales" object, and click **Continue**. (Screenshot)
3. Now you will narrow down the rows in the "customer_sales" table to those who have purchased recently.  Click **Add condition** and select **Have a property**.
![Add condition](assets/create_audience_step_3.png)
4. TODO: this bullet tells you how to narrow on the latest_sale date. (Screenshot)
5. Optionally, you can click the **Preview results** button to view the data that will be included in the audience.  This allows you to make sure the audience is as you expect before you finish creating it. (Screenshot)
6. Click **Continue** to move on to naming your audience. (Screenshot)
7. Set the name of your audience.  For instance, you could name it "recent-purchasers," and click **Finish**. 

### Create a Sync

Now that the audience is created, we need to configure how often it is pushed to Google Ads for use with the Youtube campaign.

1. Click on the "recent-purchasers" audience we created from the Audiences list. Click on the **Syncs** tab and click **Add a sync**. (Screenshot)
2. Select the Google Ads destination that we set up previously. (Screenshot)
3. Map the "email" column in the audience to the destination. (Screenshot)
4. Under "Would you like Hightouch to automatically hash your PII data?" select "Yes, automatically hash PII for me." Then click **Continue** to proceed to setting the schedule. (Screenshot)
5. Here you can select the type of schedule for sending data.  It should be set depending on how often the data changes and the candence of your campaign.  For example, we can select "Interval" and select TODO to sync the data daily.
6. Finally, click **Run** to begin the sync with Google Ads.

## Suppressing audience within Youtube campaign

This section will tell you how to exclude the audience from your Youtube campaign using Google Ads.  For more details, see the [Google documentation](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2549058?hl=en).

2. Click **Edit Exclusions**.
3. Under the "Exclude from" drop-down menu, select the campaign you want this audience excluded from.
4. Click the checkmark next to the audience that has synced from Hightouch.
5. Click **Save Audience Segment Exclusions**.
